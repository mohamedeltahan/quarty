	<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
	<p>Like most website operators, Gpless collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Gpless's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Gpless's visitors use its website. From time to time, Gpless may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
	<br>
	Gpless also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://www.Gpless.com blog posts. Gpless only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
	<br>

	<h2>2. Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
	<p>Certain visitors to Gpless's websites choose to interact with Gpless in ways that require Gpless to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Gpless gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave a comment at http://www.Gpless.com to provide a username and email address.</p>
	<br>

	<h2>3. Security</h2>
	<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

	<p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.

This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Gpless and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google's privacy policy.

If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
